This is my personal Gentoo overlay.  It contains ebuilds for my software, some
ebuilds that didnâ€™t yet make it to official tree and some hacks to get rid of
proprietary software dependencies.

# How to use

* Edit `/etc/layman/layman.cfg` and add
  `https://raw.github.com/maarons/overlay/master/repositories.xml` to
  `overlays:`.
* Fetch the new list with `layman -L`.
* Add the overlay with `layman -a maarons`.
* Enjoy=D
